# Hospital Data Monitoring & Archival System

This repository contains scripts and Python simulators for a basic log management system. [cite_start]Its primary objectives are to collect real-time patient health metrics and resource usage data, provide controlled log archiving with user selection, and generate analytical reports with device statistics and temporal patterns.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with the following directory and file structure:

hospital_data/
├── active_logs/
│   ├── heart_rate_log.log  # Current log files for heart rate data (generated by Python simulator)
│   ├── temperature_log.log # Current log files for temperature data (generated by Python simulator)
│   └── water_usage_log.log # Current log files for water usage data (generated by Python simulator)
├── archived_logs/
│   ├── heart_data_archive/        # Designated archive folder for heart rate logs
│   ├── temperature_data_archive/  # Designated archive folder for temperature logs
│   └── water_usage_data_archive/  # Designated archive folder for water usage logs
├── reports/
│   └── analysis_report.txt        # Cumulative analysis reports are appended here
